    <h1>The Natoan Conlang Project</h1>
    <p>
      The Natoan Conlang Project is an effort of mine to create a naturalistic conlang family for personal artistic purposes.
      "Natoan" is the term I use to refer to the project as a whole when speaking in English.
      The name "Natoan" is based on the current fictional endonym of the constructed proto-language for the Natoan project: <i>Hanheme Natome Nawo</i> (lit. "the forest people's words").
      <br>
      "Proto-Natoan" or "Archaic Natoan" is the name given to the conlang from which all members of the Natoan language family will be descended.
      Currently, Proto-Natoan is the only Natoan conlang in development.
